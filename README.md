## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- VS Code with the Dev Containers extension

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button
1. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/learningsteps.git
   ```

1. Move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd learningsteps
   ```

1. **Open in VS Code**:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

### 2. Configure Your Environment (.env)

Environment variables live in a `.env` file (which is **git-ignored** so you don't accidentally commit secrets). This repo ships with a template named `.env-sample`.

1. Copy the sample file to create your real `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env-sample .env
   ```

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install the Dev Containers extension** in VS Code (if not already installed)
2. **Reopen in container**: When VS Code detects the `.devcontainer` folder, click "Reopen in Container"
   - Or use Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`): `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
3. **Wait for setup**: The API container will automatically install Python, dependencies, and configure your environment.
   The PostgreSQL Database container will also automatically be created.

### 4. Verify the PostgreSQL Database Is Running

In a terminal outside of VS Code, run:

   ```bash
      docker ps
   ```

You should see the postgres service running.

### 5. Run the API

Make sure you are in the root of your project in the terminal (inside VS Code, while container is running):

   ```bash
     ./start.sh
   ```

### 6. Test Everything Works! 🎉

1. **Visit the API docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
1. **Create your first entry** In the Docs UI Use the POST `/entries` endpoint to create a new journal entry.
1. **View your entries** using the GET `/entries` endpoint to see what you've created!

**🎯 Once you can create and see entries, you're ready to start implementing the missing endpoints!**

## Your Learning Goals

Complete a learning journal API that allows users to:

- ✅ **Store journal entries** (already implemented)
- ✅ **Retrieve all journal entries** (already implemented)
- ❌ **Retrieve single journal entry** (you need to implement)  
- ❌ **Delete specific journal entries** (you need to implement)
- ✅ **Update journal entries** (already implemented)
- ✅ **Delete all entries** (already implemented)
- ❌ **Setup logging** (you need to implement)

## 🎯 Development Tasks (Your Work!)

You'll use **feature branches** and **Pull Requests (PRs)** for each task. Complete these tasks in your forked repository using feature branches.

### 1. API Implementation (Required)

#### Task 1a: GET Single Entry Endpoint

- Branch: `feature/get-single-entry`
- [ ] Implement **GET /entries/{entry_id}** in `api/routers/journal_router.py`

#### Task 1b: DELETE Single Entry Endpoint

- Branch: `feature/delete-entry`
- [ ] Implement **DELETE /entries/{entry_id}** in `api/routers/journal_router.py`

### 2. Logging Setup (Required)

- Branch: `feature/logging-setup`
- [ ] Configure logging in `api/main.py`

### 3. Data Model Improvements (Optional)

- Branch: `feature/data-model-improvements`  
- [ ] Add validators to `api/models/entry.py`

### 4. Cloud CLI Setup (Required for Deployment)

- Branch: `feature/cloud-cli-setup`
- [ ] Uncomment one CLI tool in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

## 📊 Data Schema

Each journal entry follows this structure:

| Field       | Type      | Description                                | Validation                   |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| id          | string    | Unique identifier (UUID)                   | Auto-generated               |
| work        | string    | What did you work on today?                | Required, max 256 characters |
| struggle    | string    | What's one thing you struggled with today? | Required, max 256 characters |
| intention   | string    | What will you study/work on tomorrow?      | Required, max 256 characters |
| created_at  | datetime  | When entry was created                     | Auto-generated UTC           |
| updated_at  | datetime  | When entry was last updated                | Auto-updated UTC             |

## 🗄️ Explore Your Database (Optional)

Want to see your data directly in the database? You can connect to PostgreSQL using VS Code's PostgreSQL extension:

### 1. Install PostgreSQL Extension

1. **Install the PostgreSQL extension** in VS Code (search for "PostgreSQL" by Chris Kolkman)
2. **Restart VS Code** after installation

### 2. Connect to Your Database

1. **Open the PostgreSQL extension** (click the PostgreSQL icon in the sidebar)
2. **Click "Add Connection"** or the "+" button
3. **Enter these connection details**:
   - **Host name**: `postgres`
   - **User name**: `postgres`
   - **Password**: `postgres`
   - **Port**: `5432`
   - **Conection Type**: `Standard/No SSL`
   - **Database**: `learning_journal`
   - **Display name**: `Learning Journal DB` (or any name you prefer)

### 3. Explore Your Data

1. **Expand your connection** in the PostgreSQL panel
2. **Left-click on "Learning Journal DB" to expand**
3. **Right-click on "learning_journal"**
4. **Select "New Query"**
5. **Type this query** to see all your entries:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM entries;
   ```

6. **Run the query** to see all your journal data! (Ctrl/Cmd + Enter OR use the PostgreSQL command pallete: Run Query)

You can now explore the database structure, see exactly how your data is stored, and run custom queries to understand PostgreSQL better.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If the API won't start:**

- Make sure the PostgreSQL container is running: `docker ps`
- Check the container logs: `docker logs your-postgres-container-name`
- Restart the database: `docker restart your-postgres-container-name`

**If you can't connect to the database:**

- Verify the `.env` file exists and has the correct DATABASE_URL
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Try restarting the dev container: `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`

**If the dev container won't open:**

- Ensure Docker Desktop is running
- Install the "Dev Containers" extension in VS Code
- Try: `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`
